***Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)*** follows a coarse-grained structure where the features of an application are broken down into smaller components as services comprised of some tasks. This type of architecture allowed us to horizontally scale each service, and also more flexibility and performance at the cost of increasing the complexity of the architecture compared to the monolithic. Each service ***can be written in different languages*** and the ***communication*** between them can be done with the help of a ***middleware***

**[[Microservices]]** have technically evolved out of SOA where those features are further broken down into tasks level services making it fine-grained architecture. ***While Service Oriented Architecture follows a centrally governed architecture where each component is controlled by a central middleware, microservices are a decentralized governing system where components talk directly to each other*** can be written in different programming languages and communicate without the help of any broker and are done with the help of REST API.

The differences between microservices and SOA can be a bit fuzzy while the technical aspects of both of them can be drawn between the microservices and the SOA architecture somehow, and most probably around the role of the "Enterprise Service Bus", When it comes to the defining difference, it is pretty easy to consider the difference as one of the scopes. The ***SOA*** architecture was one of the extensive efforts to standardize the way all the web services work ***in an organization*** to talk to and integrate with each other, and when it comes to the ***microservice architecture***, it is a kind of ***application-specific*** platform.
