- Software architectural style
- set of small, independent services that communicate with each other through ***APIs***
- monolithic applications are ineffective - scaling such applications is expensive since we have to scale the whole even though only a particular service gets a lot of traffic
- microservices can be built using different technologies and ***deployed, scaled***, updated independently
- they have their own independent ***databases***

## Principles of Microservices
1. Modelled around business domain: each domain focuses on one thing and its associated logic
	- can migrate easily to next version
	- scale independently
2. Culture of Automation:Â there is an increase in the number of deployment units compared to monolithic architecture -> the need for ***continuous integration and continuous delivery***.
3. Hide Implementation Details: reduce coupling
4. Decentralization: each service to manage their own database
5. Deploy Independently
6. Failure Isolation
7.  Highly Observable: logging events and stats
## Disadvantages of Microservices
- Additional complexity introduced by inter-process communication mechanisms between services.
- Difficult to create a consistent testing environment involving all services.
- Requires high level of automation to manage multiple instances of diffident services.
- Managing multiple databases.
- Inter-process calls are slow.
- Difficult debugging.
- Complexity in DevOps.
- Higher monitoring costs.
- Formal documentation overhead.
- Lack of governance.
